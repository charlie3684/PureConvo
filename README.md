# PureConvo

**PureConvo** is a minimalist and efficient Python-based AI chat application. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, it enables users to interact with AI models locally or remotely, with options to configure memory, load a static prompt, and log conversations. Whether you're looking for a lightweight AI companion or a customizable chatbot for experiments, PureConvo delivers a seamless and straightforward experience.

## Features

- **Local or Remote Models**:
  - Use `.gguf` models stored locally or download remote models directly to the cache.

- **Customizable Memory**:
  - Retain context between interactions or choose a memory-less one-off chat.

- **Static Prompt Loading**:
  - Personalize the chatbot's behavior by providing instructions in a `ai.prompt.txt` file.

- **Session Logging**:
  - Log user-AI interactions in timestamped files for later reference.
